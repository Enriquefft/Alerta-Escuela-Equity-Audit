  "conclusion": "Detecting FNR > 0.50 at 80% power requires 46 dropout observations (~8 ENAHO years). Detecting the gap vs castellano requires 192 (~32 years). Survey-based intersectional fairness auditing cannot produce significant results for groups contributing ~6 positive observations per survey year. This demonstrates why administrative data (SIAGIE) must be opened for meaningful intersectional auditing."
