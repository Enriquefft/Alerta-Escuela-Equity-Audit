# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-17)

**Core value:** The fairness audit is the product. Models exist to be audited, not to achieve SOTA.
**Current focus:** v2.0-publication — publication figures, LaTeX tables, repo cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 14 (Publication Figures) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (12-01 done)
Status: Phase 12 complete. 7 figures (PNG+PDF) + 26 gate tests pass.
Last activity: 2026-02-17 -- Phase 12 executed

Progress: [████░░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: ~9 min
- Total execution time: ~132 min

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v2.0]: Code deliverables only — paper writing, media pitches, blog posts are manual/out of scope
- [v2.0]: Phase numbering continues from v1.0 (12, 13, 14)
- [v2.0]: M4.md is the reference document for paper structure and figure requirements
- [v1.0-audit]: Platt constants fixed: A=-6.236085, B=4.442308 (model_results.json authoritative)
- [v1.0-audit]: Small samples (Matsigenka n=11, Achuar n=26) already flagged with flagged_small_sample
