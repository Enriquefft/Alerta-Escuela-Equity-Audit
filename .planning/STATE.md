## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: specs.md is authoritative SSOT -- all implementation details come from spec
- [Roadmap]: Phase structure follows spec Section 9 (Phases 1-11) plus Phase 0 for environment
- [Roadmap]: Gate tests are integral to each phase, not a separate phase
- [Roadmap]: DATA-10 (parquet saves) assigned to Phase 4; TEST-01/02/03 assigned to Phase 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0: ENAHO raw data must be manually downloaded or fetched via download.py before Phase 1 can proceed
- Phase 7: ONNX float32 tolerance may need relaxing to 1e-4 (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- Phase 8: fairlearn sample_params API needs careful testing (nested dict, not flat dict)
