<objective>
Final compile, page count verification, and human review gate. The executor runs pdflatex twice
(for cross-references), checks page count, and then pauses for the author to review the compiled
PDF before this phase is marked complete.

Purpose: This is the only human gate in Phase 18. The author needs to read the compiled PDF and
confirm the framing changes read naturally, the new evidence is integrated correctly, and the paper
is ready to move to the media/arXiv phase.

Output: Human-approved paper/main.pdf and PHASE COMPLETE signal.

  <name>Task 1: Final compile and page count verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run pdflatex twice from the paper/ directory to resolve all cross-references:

  cd /home/hybridz/Projects/Alerta-Escuela-Equity-Audit/paper
  pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
  pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex

Check for any remaining errors:
  grep -E "^!" /home/hybridz/Projects/Alerta-Escuela-Equity-Audit/paper/main.log | head -20

Check page count:
  pdfinfo /home/hybridz/Projects/Alerta-Escuela-Equity-Audit/paper/main.pdf | grep Pages

If page count > 22:
- Identify which new sections are longest using word count per section
- Apply additional cuts to Related Work (remove another paragraph from the most verbose subsection)
- Recompile and recheck
- Do NOT cut Limitations, Discussion, or any fairness results tables

If compilation errors exist:
- Check main.log for the specific line numbers causing errors
- Fix undefined \ref labels (if new tables/figures were not labeled correctly)
- Fix overfull hbox warnings in new table environments (try adding \small inside tabular or
  switching to table* for any overflow tables)

Report final page count and compilation status in task output.

</verify>
  <done>
- pdflatex exits without fatal errors (exit code 0 or no ! lines in log)
- Page count is 22 or fewer
- main.pdf exists and is non-empty (> 100KB)

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 18 paper rewrite:
- New title: "Who Gets Missed? A Proxy Equity Audit of Survey-Derived Dropout Risk in Peru"
- Abstract rewritten with proxy caveat in paragraph 1
- "What We Are NOT Claiming" paragraph at end of Introduction
- ENAHO-vs-SIAGIE comparison table in Data section
- Predictive Validity subsection (lift 2.54x, BSS 0.040, calibration-by-decile figure)
- Algorithm Independence subsection with 5-model cross-model FNR table
- Fairness tables updated with inline 95% CI format
- n=89 urban indigenous CI prominently flagged with width caveat
- Limitations contains direct "We have not accessed Alerta Escuela's actual predictions" statement
- Related Work trimmed to stay within 22-page budget
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open paper/main.pdf (recompiled by Task 1)
2. Check title page: confirm "Who Gets Missed? A Proxy Equity Audit..." and no "Alerta Escuela" in title
3. Read Abstract: confirm first paragraph contains proxy caveat before any numerical results
4. Read Introduction: confirm "What We Are NOT Claiming" paragraph is present and clear
5. Read Data section: confirm ENAHO-vs-SIAGIE table is framed as limitation, not strength
6. Read Results: confirm Predictive Validity subsection appears BEFORE Fairness Analysis
7. Read Predictive Validity: confirm lift=2.54x, BSS=0.040, calibration figure present,
   honest low-PR-AUC framing ("we acknowledge that PR-AUC of 0.236 is modest")
8. Read Algorithm Independence: confirm 5-model FNR table, Aimara outlier footnote
9. Read Fairness Language table: confirm inline CI format "0.633 [0.608, 0.656]" for FNR column
10. Read Intersectional section: confirm "0.753 [0.211, 1.000]" with n=89 caveat prominently stated
11. Read Limitations: confirm direct proxy statement is the FIRST sentence
12. Check page count: must be 22 or fewer pages
13. Scan for any sentence that says "Alerta Escuela [does/shows/exhibits]" without "proxy" or
    "of this type" qualification — should find zero such sentences
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if paper is ready for arXiv/FAccT 2027 submission queue.
Describe any issues to fix (e.g., "fix CI format in table_07", "page count is 23, cut more
from Related Work", "framing in Conclusion still too direct").

Phase 18 complete when human types "approved":
- Paper compiles: pdflatex main.tex exits without errors
- Page count: pdfinfo main.pdf | grep Pages shows ≤ 22
- Human has read PDF and confirmed all 13 verification points above
- No "Alerta Escuela [does X]" sentences remain in non-contextual positions
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- paper/main.pdf compiled without errors
- Page count 22 or fewer
- Human reviewer confirms:
  1. Title correctly uses "Proxy Equity Audit" framing (no "Alerta Escuela" in title)
  2. Abstract opens with proxy caveat
  3. "What We Are NOT Claiming" paragraph present
  4. All new subsections present and correctly positioned
  5. CI inline format used in fairness tables
  6. n=89 caveat prominently reported
  7. Paper ready for arXiv/FAccT 2027 submission queue
