<objective>
Rewrite the framing and tone of paper/main.tex to reflect honest proxy audit positioning. This
covers the title, abstract, introduction (including contributions list and "What We Are NOT
Claiming" paragraph), all occurrences of direct attribution to Alerta Escuela in Discussion and
Conclusion, and the Limitations direct statement.

Purpose: Every reader — including peer reviewers — must understand from the first paragraph that
this paper audits a proxy model, not the actual Alerta Escuela system. The current framing implies
a direct system audit we cannot verify.

Output: paper/main.tex with proxy-honest framing throughout all sections. No new evidence is added
in this plan — only framing corrections. New subsections (Predictive Validity, Algorithm
Independence, ENAHO-vs-SIAGIE table) are added in Plan 02.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite title, abstract, and Introduction framing</name>
  <files>paper/main.tex</files>
  <action>
Make the following targeted edits to paper/main.tex:

**1. Title (line 20):**
Replace:
  \title{Equity Audit of Peru's Alerta Escuela Early Warning System: Who Gets Missed?}
With:
  \title{Who Gets Missed? A Proxy Equity Audit of Survey-Derived Dropout Risk in Peru}

**2. Abstract (line 36) — full rewrite:**
Replace the entire abstract content with a rewritten version that:
- Opens paragraph 1 with the proxy caveat BEFORE any results: state that the paper does not
  audit the actual Alerta Escuela system, but constructs a proxy model from ENAHO survey data
  targeting the same school-age population, and uses it to examine what fairness disparities
  can emerge from survey-derived dropout prediction
- Keeps all numerical results (PR-AUC 0.236, FNR 0.63/0.22, FNR 0.753 urban indigenous)
- Includes dual contribution framing: (1) proxy audit framework for independent accountability
  using only public data; (2) empirical documentation of equity gaps in Peruvian dropout risk
- Does NOT open with "Peru's Alerta Escuela early warning system aims to identify students..."
  — that implies we know the system's behavior. Open with the proxy framing instead.
- Updates algorithm independence claim from "LightGBM and XGBoost" to "five model families"
- Keywords: keep as-is or add "proxy audit" if space allows

**3. Introduction contributions list (lines 65-71) — add dual framing:**
Update the \begin{itemize} contributions list to add a bullet about the methodological
contribution (proxy audit framework). The new first or second bullet should read approximately:
"A proxy equity audit framework demonstrating that independent algorithmic accountability is
achievable using only publicly available survey data, without access to the system's training data
or operational predictions — enabling accountability where direct system access is unavailable."
The existing bullets about fairness audit, intersectional analysis, spatial proxy mechanism, and
open-source framework can be condensed to three bullets to save space (merge the framework bullet
with the open-source bullet).

**4. Introduction final paragraph before RQs / after last paragraph — add "What We Are NOT Claiming":**
After the paragraph ending "...applying SHAP TreeExplainer to decompose predictions into
feature-level contributions" (lines 61-63, the methodology summary), insert a new paragraph:

"What this paper does not claim is equally important. We have not accessed Alerta Escuela's
actual predictions, training data, or operational feature set. This paper audits a proxy model
built from ENAHO survey data targeting the same school-age population. We do not claim that the
actual Alerta Escuela system exhibits the specific disparities documented here, that SIAGIE-trained
models would produce identical fairness profiles, or that the Ministry of Education's system is
biased in this way. Our findings demonstrate what disparities can emerge from survey-derived
dropout prediction in Peru's demographic context — a class of model to which Alerta Escuela-style
systems belong, but about which we make no specific operational claims."

Place this paragraph at the end of Introduction, after the contributions list (not before).
Adjust placement to maintain flow — it can go just before the final "As educational EWS
proliferate..." sentence if that sentence exists, or as the last paragraph before Related Work.

  <name>Task 2: Framing sweep — Discussion, Conclusion, Limitations</name>
  <files>paper/main.tex</files>
  <action>
Review all remaining occurrences of "Alerta Escuela" in main.tex (after Task 1 edits) and update
each to use correct proxy framing. The 9 original occurrences to handle (excluding title and
abstract already handled in Task 1):

**Line 48 (Introduction, describing Alerta Escuela context):**
Keep "Peru's Alerta Escuela, operated by MINEDU, flags students at risk..." — this describes
the actual system as context, which is fine and accurate. No change needed.

**Line 52 (Introduction, SIAGIE reference):**
"we construct a proxy replication of an Alerta Escuela--style dropout prediction model" — this
framing is already correct. No change needed.

**Line 79 (Related Work, Knowles comparison):**
"a scale comparable to Peru's Alerta Escuela" — describing scale, factual. Keep as-is.

**Line 113 (Data section opening):**
"The Ministry of Education (MINEDU) operates Alerta Escuela, which uses data from SIAGIE to flag
students at risk of dropout" — contextually accurate description. Keep as-is. The sentence that
follows already says "we use ENAHO survey data as a proxy to construct and audit an Alerta
Escuela--style prediction model."

**Line 302 (Discussion, Summary of Findings):**
Replace: "Our equity audit of an Alerta Escuela--style dropout prediction model reveals..."
With: "Our proxy equity audit reveals three principal findings about what disparities can emerge
from survey-derived dropout prediction in Peru's multilingual, geographically diverse context,
each corresponding to a research question."

**Line 336 (Limitations, first limitation — IMPORTANT):**
This paragraph already says "we audit an Alerta Escuela--style model...not the actual Alerta
Escuela system." Strengthen it by prepending the locked direct statement:
Add as a new opening sentence: "We have not accessed Alerta Escuela's actual predictions. This
paper audits a proxy model built from ENAHO survey data targeting the same school-age population."
Then the existing text can follow naturally.

**Line 360 (Conclusion):**
Replace: "This paper presents a comprehensive equity audit of an Alerta Escuela--style dropout
prediction model using six years..."
With: "This paper presents a proxy equity audit of survey-derived dropout risk in Peru, using six
years of nationally representative ENAHO data..."

**Lines 304-308 (Discussion RQ1 summary):**
"the model achieves a false negative rate (FNR) of only 0.22..." — this language is neutral (refers
to "the model"). Keep as-is; it does not attribute behavior to Alerta Escuela.

**Lines 362-364 (Conclusion RQ summaries):**
Check: "Our audit evaluates fairness across seven demographic dimensions..." — change "Our audit"
to "This proxy audit" for consistency.

After all edits, verify no sentence of the form "[The system/Alerta Escuela] [does/exhibits/shows]
X" remains in Discussion, Conclusion, or Results without "proxy" or "of this type" qualification.

- "We have not accessed Alerta Escuela's actual predictions." appears in Limitations section
- Discussion opening sentence uses "proxy equity audit" framing
- Conclusion opening sentence uses "proxy equity audit of survey-derived dropout risk"
- No sentence attributes model behavior directly to Alerta Escuela system (context-descriptive
  mentions in Data/Related Work are acceptable and remain)
