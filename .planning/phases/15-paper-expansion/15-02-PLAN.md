  <name>Task 1: Expand Data, Methods, and Results sections</name>
  <files>paper/main.tex</files>
  <action>
Expand three sections in paper/main.tex. All existing tables and figures must remain in place — add prose around them, not replacements.

**Data section expansion (~2 pages):**

Add Peru education context paragraph BEFORE the current ENAHO description:
- Peru has ~8 million school-age children. Dropout is a persistent challenge, especially in rural areas and among indigenous-language communities. MINEDU operates Alerta Escuela using SIAGIE administrative data. We cannot access SIAGIE directly, so we use ENAHO as a proxy. Cite minedu2023alerta, minedu2022estadistica.

Add ENAHO methodology details:
- Nationally representative, multi-stage stratified sample. Survey weights (FACTOR07) account for complex sampling design. Modules 200 (demographics) and 300 (education) joined by household/person ID. Cite inei2023enaho.
- Temporal coverage: 2018-2023 (6 waves). 2020 is COVID-affected (phone interviews, reduced sample of ~13,755 vs ~25,000 typical year, 52% P303 nulls dropped).
- Dropout operationalization: child aged 6-17 enrolled previous year but not currently attending (binary outcome).
- Sample: 150,135 individual-year observations after cleaning (dropping P303-null rows, unmatched Module 200-300 joins).

Expand table/figure discussion:
- After Table 1 (sample): Discuss sample composition — language distribution, urban/rural split, regional representation.
- After Table 2 (language): Discuss the 34% higher dropout rate for indigenous speakers. Note Awajun rate (0.2047) vs Castellano (0.1526).
- After Table 3 and Figure 1 (region/poverty heatmap): Discuss Selva/Sierra vs Costa patterns, poverty gradient.

Add spatial data paragraph:
- District-level features merged from census data (population, literacy rates) and nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic activity. Administrative data on primaria/secundaria completion rates per district. 95.9% nightlight merge rate, 100% admin and census merge rates.

**Methods section expansion (~2 pages):**

Add feature engineering subsection or detailed paragraph:
- 25 features in 3 categories: (1) Individual demographics (age, sex, nationality, language dummies), (2) Household characteristics (parent education in years, poverty index, working status, household size), (3) District-level spatial (nightlight z-score, census population/literacy z-scores, admin primaria/secundaria rates, district historical dropout rate). Cite macnell2023implementing for survey-weighted ML methodology.

Add model selection rationale:
- Logistic regression for interpretability and coefficient-based inference (statsmodels GLM with Binomial family for SEs/p-values). LightGBM for predictive performance (gradient boosting handles nonlinearities and interactions without explicit specification). XGBoost for algorithm-independence verification. Cite ke2017lightgbm, chen2016xgboost.
- Temporal split rationale: 2018-2021 train (n=98,023), 2022 validation (n=26,477), 2023 test (n=25,635). Mimics real-world deployment where models predict future cohorts.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optuna with 100 trials for LightGBM, early stopping on validation average_precision. Cite akiba2019optuna.

Add calibration paragraph:
- Platt scaling applied to LightGBM raw probabilities. Brier score reduced from 0.212 to 0.116 (45% reduction). Boosted trees produce sigmoid-distorted probabilities requiring calibration. Cite platt1999probabilistic, niculescumizil2005predicting.

Add fairness framework paragraph:
- Fairlearn MetricFrame for disaggregated evaluation across 7 dimensions (language, region, rurality, poverty quintile, sex, nationality, age group) and 3 intersections (language x rurality, language x poverty, language x region). Metrics: FNR (missed dropouts), FPR (false alarms), precision, PR-AUC. All computed with survey weights. Cite bird2020fairlearn, saleiro2018aequitas, hardt2016equality.

**Results section expansion (~1 page additional):**

After Table 4 (models): Expand model comparison discussion. LightGBM and XGBoost near-identical PR-AUC (0.262 vs 0.263) confirms algorithm independence (ratio 1.0006). This means fairness findings generalize across gradient boosting implementations, not an artifact of one algorithm.

After Table 5 (LR coefficients): Discuss how indigenous language variables dominate the linear model (highest odds ratios) but SHAP shows tree model operates differently — predicts through continuous spatial features, not categorical identity features. This paradigm difference (0/5 overlap in top-5 features) is itself a finding.

After calibration figure: Discuss why calibration matters for fairness — uncalibrated probabilities systematically over-estimate risk for groups with high base rates. Platt scaling parameters (A=-6.236, B=4.443) compress the probability range. Calibrated test PR-AUC = 0.236 (val 0.262, gap 0.023, within 0.07 threshold).

**CRITICAL constraints:**
- Do NOT modify any \input{tables/...} or \includegraphics{figures/...} commands
- Do NOT change any numerical values — use exact numbers from the existing text and MEMORY.md
- Do NOT add new tables or figures — only add prose around existing ones

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Expand Fairness Analysis and Discussion, add Limitations + Ethical Considerations + Conclusion</name>
  <files>paper/main.tex</files>
  <action>
Expand remaining sections and add new ones. Section order in paper must be: ... Results > Fairness Analysis > Discussion > Limitations > Ethical Considerations > Conclusion > Appendix > Bibliography.

**Fairness Analysis expansion (~1-2 pages additional):**

After Table 6 (fairness by language): Expand the surveillance-invisibility trade-off discussion. The FNR-FPR inverse relationship is NOT a model bug — it's the mathematical consequence of Chouldechova's (2017) impossibility result applied to groups with different base rates. Indigenous speakers have higher base dropout rates, so the model flags them more aggressively (low FNR, high FPR = surveillance). Spanish speakers have lower base rates, so the model misses most of their dropouts (high FNR, low FPR = invisibility). Cite chouldechova2017fair.

Add paragraph on OTHER dimensions (not just language):
- Region: Selva and Sierra show lower FNR than Costa (the model detects rural/remote dropouts better). But calibration gap: "high risk" predictions mean 28.1% actual dropout in Selva vs 38.9% in Sierra.
- Poverty: Monotonic relationship — poorer quintiles get flagged more but also have higher base rates.
- Sex: Minimal gap (FNR difference only 0.026) — sex is not a major axis of disparity in this model.
- Nationality: Unusable dimension (n=27 non-Peruvian in test set). Mention briefly with sample caveat.
- Age: Older students (15-17) flagged more accurately than younger (6-11).

After Table 7 (intersection): Expand the urban indigenous finding. This is the paper's starkest result — FNR=0.753 means the model misses 3 out of 4 dropouts in this group. Explain WHY: the model predicts through spatial-structural features (nightlights, district rates, rurality) that code indigenous communities as rural. Urban indigenous students "break the spatial profile" — they live in urban areas but face the same educational barriers. The model has no pathway to identify them. Cite crenshaw1989demarginalizing, buolamwini2018gender. Note sample caveat: n=89 for urban other-indigenous.

After SHAP tables/figures: Expand interpretation. Model's top features (age, nightlight z-score, working status, census literacy z-score, poverty index z-score) are ALL spatial-structural. Identity features (es_mujer rank 16/25, es_peruano rank 25/25) contribute minimally. This means the model encodes structural inequities without using identity features directly — the fairness problem is in the data's structure, not the model's explicit use of protected attributes. This answers RQ2.

**Discussion section rewrite (~1.5 pages):**

Rewrite entirely. Current version has prescriptive recommendations — replace with evidence + open questions per CONTEXT.md.

Structure:
1. **Summary of findings through RQ lens:** RQ1 answer (disparities exist along surveillance-invisibility axis), RQ2 answer (model encodes through spatial-structural proxies), RQ3 answer (intersections amplify — urban indigenous FNR 0.753).
2. **The spatial proxy mechanism:** Our SHAP analysis reveals that the model essentially uses geography as a proxy for everything. This is efficient for prediction but creates systematic blind spots for populations that don't match spatial stereotypes. Cite perdomo2023difficult (structural features predict as well as individual risk scores).
3. **Implications as open questions, not prescriptions:** "Our findings raise several considerations for operators of educational early warning systems:" (use itemize)
   - Group-specific threshold adjustment could equalize FNR across language groups, but at what cost to overall precision?
   - Supplementary identification mechanisms for urban indigenous students could reduce invisibility, but how should such mechanisms be designed without additional surveillance?
   - Regular fairness auditing could catch disparities before deployment, but who should conduct audits and with what authority?
   Cite mcmahon2020reenvisioning.
4. **Generalizability paragraph:** Our findings likely apply to similar EWS across Latin America that use administrative/spatial features for dropout prediction. The surveillance-invisibility dynamic may emerge wherever prediction models operate on populations with heterogeneous base rates and correlated spatial-demographic structure. Cite adelman2018predicting, villegas2023supporting.

**CRITICAL tone:** "Considerations" not "recommendations." "Our findings raise questions" not "We recommend." Do NOT antagonize MINEDU or Alerta Escuela. Frame as "EWS systems in general."

**Limitations section (NEW, ~0.5-1 page):**

Add as \section{Limitations} AFTER Discussion, BEFORE Ethical Considerations.

Content:
1. **Proxy replication:** We audit an Alerta Escuela-style model built on ENAHO survey data, not the actual Alerta Escuela system which uses SIAGIE administrative records. Our findings demonstrate what disparities CAN emerge in dropout prediction, not what disparities definitively exist in the deployed system.
2. **Self-reported mother tongue:** ENAHO's P300 variable captures mother tongue by self-report. Bilingual speakers may report Spanish, potentially undercounting indigenous-language prevalence and understating disparities.
3. **COVID-affected 2020 sample:** The 2020 wave used phone interviews with a reduced sample (~13,755 vs ~25,000 typical). 52% of education attendance records (P303) were null and dropped. This year contributes fewer observations and may not represent the same population as in-person survey years.
4. **Small subgroup samples:** Some intersections have small samples: n=89 for urban other-indigenous (our starkest finding), n=27 for non-Peruvian nationality (rendering this dimension unusable for reliable inference). Results for small subgroups should be interpreted with appropriate caution.
5. **Survey weights in ML:** While we incorporate FACTOR07 survey weights throughout, the theoretical properties of survey-weighted gradient boosting are not fully established. Cite macnell2023implementing.

Do NOT mention "synthetic data" per CONTEXT.md decision.

**Ethical Considerations section (NEW, ~0.5-1 page):**

Add as \section{Ethical Considerations} AFTER Limitations, BEFORE Conclusion.

**Positionality statement paragraph:**
"The author is Peruvian, a computer science self-learner at Universidad de Ingenieria y Tecnologia (UTEC), and co-founder of Genera, an educational technology startup. This positionality shapes the work in important ways: as someone who believes AI can address education's one-size-fits-all problem, I undertook this audit precisely because systems deployed without scrutiny risk deepening the inequities I aim to address. I am not from the indigenous communities most affected by the disparities documented here, and this work should be understood as an outsider's technical audit rather than a community-centered assessment."

**Generative AI disclosure paragraph:**
"Portions of the data pipeline code and manuscript preparation were assisted by generative AI tools (Claude, Anthropic). The author was responsible for all research design, methodological decisions, result interpretation, and substantive writing. AI assistance was used for code implementation and editorial refinement."

**Data ethics paragraph:**
"This study uses publicly available, de-identified survey data (ENAHO) and does not involve direct human subjects interaction. ENAHO microdata are released by INEI for research purposes. No individual students can be identified from the analysis."

**Conclusion section rewrite (~0.5-1 page):**

Expand the current 1-paragraph conclusion. Structure:
1. Restate what the paper did: comprehensive equity audit of an Alerta Escuela-style dropout prediction model using 6 years of nationally representative data.
2. Answer each RQ briefly: RQ1 — surveillance-invisibility axis across language groups. RQ2 — spatial-structural proxy mechanism, not direct identity features. RQ3 — urban indigenous FNR=0.753, invisible to single-axis analysis.
3. Broader significance: As educational EWS proliferate across Latin America and globally, fairness auditing must become standard practice. Single-axis evaluation is insufficient — intersectional analysis reveals the populations most systematically missed.
4. Closing: "The evidence presented here demonstrates that dropout prediction systems can encode systematic inequities even without explicitly discriminatory intent. Understanding who gets missed is a prerequisite for building systems that serve all students equitably."
