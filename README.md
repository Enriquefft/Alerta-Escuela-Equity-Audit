# Alerta-Escuela-Equity-Audit
First independent equity audit of Peru's "Alerta Escuela," a LightGBM ML system deployed by MINEDU (Oct 2020) to predict student dropout risk. Uses gender, mother tongue, and nationality as features. Non-Peruvian nationality is a top predictor; female gender increases predicted dropout risk in secundaria.
